Feng-shui is a Chinese word means harmonizing the surrounding environment that benefits to the people living or working in the place. The 888ml Coco-cola fits Feng Shui very well. Number 8 means fortune to Chinese, having trip 8s is triple the fortune! The lucky numbers are not really related to Feng-shui, but color black represent water element in Feng-shui. Water element in water equals to super water!

Do not drink the 888ml Coca-cola when you see it in a Chinese company. You will be energized with fortune but you will break the harmony of the place!
