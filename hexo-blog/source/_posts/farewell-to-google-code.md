I have a few little inactive projects hosted on Google Code. Last night I got a sad email from Google,
> Hello,
>
> Earlier today, Google announced we will be turning down Google Code Project Hosting. The service started in 2006 with the goal of providing a scalable and reliable way of hosting open source projects. Since that time, millions of people have contributed to open source projects hosted on the site.
>
> But a lot has changed since 2006\. In the past nine years, many other options for hosting open source projects have popped up, along with vibrant communities of developers. Its time to recognize that Google Codes mission to provide open source projects a home has been accomplished by others, such as GitHub and Bitbucket.
>
> We will be shutting down Google Code over the coming months. Starting today, the site will no longer accept new projects but will remain functionally unchanged until August 2015\. After that, project data will be read-only. Early next year, the site will shut down, but project data will be available for download in an archive format.
>
> As the owner of the following projects, you have several options for migrating your data.
>
> _some stupid project_
>
> ...
> -The Google Code team
More details on migration can be found in [Google's blog](http://google-opensource.blogspot.hk/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html). The export process takes a long time even for tiny project.

SVN lovers should miss you Google Code. They will migrate to sourceforge.net, but they have to do it manually without help from the export tool. Farewell.
