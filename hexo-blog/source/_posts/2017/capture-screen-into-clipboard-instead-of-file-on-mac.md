Many people know how to capture screen into a file on Mac by using {% kbd Command %} + {% kbd Shift %} + {% kbd 3 %} for a full screenshot and {% kbd 4 %} for cross hair selection tool. However, I found I want to paste the captured image into an editor directly more than saving the image into a file. The hotkey for taking a screenshot to the clipboard is very inconvenient, which is {% kbd Control %} + {% kbd Command %} + {% kbd Shift %} + {% kbd 3 %} or {% kbd 4 %}. The following steps show how to reassign the shortcuts for taking a screenshot to the clipboard instead of a file.

1\. Go to System Preference and click Keyboard,

2\. Click on the second key to reassign {% kbd Command %} + {% kbd Shift %} + {% kbd 3 %}  for "Copy picture of screen to the clipboard". It is fine to see the conflict icon as it will be resolved later

3\. Click the first key to reassign the {% kbd Control %} + {% kbd Command %} + {% kbd Shift %} + {% kbd 3 %} , which is less frequnelty using.

4\. Do the same for capturing with cross hair selection tool. My personal preference for taking screenshot to a file is {% kbd Option %} + {% kbd Command %} + {% kbd Shift %} + {% kbd 3 %} ,
