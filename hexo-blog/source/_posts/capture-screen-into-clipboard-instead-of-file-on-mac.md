Many people know how to capture screen into a file on Mac by using ```Command + Shift + 3``` for a full screenshot and 4 for cross hair selection tool. However, I found I want to paste the captured image into an editor directly more than saving the image into a file. The hotkey for taking a screenshot to the clipboard is very inconvenient, which is ```Control + Command + Shift + 3``` or ```Control + Command + Shift + 3```. The following steps show how to reassign the shortcuts for taking a screenshot to the clipboard instead of a file.

1\. Go to System Preference and click Keyboard,

2\. Click on the second key to reassign ```Command + Shift + 3``` for "Copy picture of screen to the clipboard". It is fine to see the conflict icon as it will be resolved later

3\. Click the first key to reassign the ```Control + Command + Shift + 3```, which is less frequnelty using.

4\. Do the same for capturing with cross hair selection tool. My personal preference for taking screenshot to a file is ```Option + Command + Shift + 3``` or ```Option + Command + Shift + 3```,
