## Group by in nosql
### I read that nosql couldn't support "group by", count, or queries based on 2 fields. Without this capability, many reports can't be produced
### For example: a report to display defects (or called findings) for ATA chapter 25, status = open, priority = high. Can we run such query from one table? I know it's called collection.
### I read we need to duplicate the records in different collection using different structure, so that simple nosql query can retrieve the data.
